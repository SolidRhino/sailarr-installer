The Sailarr Installer project exists to solve the complexity of setting up a modern, automated media server that leverages cloud storage (Real-Debrid) instead of local downloads.

**Problem Solved:**
Manually configuring a full media stack with services like Plex, Radarr, Sonarr, and the necessary components to integrate Real-Debrid is a time-consuming and error-prone process. It requires deep knowledge of Docker, networking, and the specific configurations of over a dozen applications.

**Core Objectives:**
1.  **Automation:** To provide a single, interactive script (`setup.sh`) that handles the entire installation and configuration process from start to finish.
2.  **Simplicity:** To abstract away the complex inter-service connections, API key handling, and file permissions, allowing users with minimal technical expertise to deploy a powerful media server.
3.  **Efficiency:** To create a "streaming-first" architecture where media is streamed directly from Real-Debrid via a mounted filesystem, eliminating the need for large local storage for media files.
4.  **Best Practices:** To incorporate community-vetted standards, such as TRaSH Guides for quality profiles, ensuring an optimal and high-quality media library.

**User Experience Goals:**
The ideal user experience is one of "set it and forget it." A user should be able to run one command, answer a few straightforward questions, and have a fully functional, auto-updating, and self-managing media server within minutes. Post-installation, the user should only need to interact with the high-level applications (Plex and Overseerr) to request and watch content, without worrying about the underlying mechanics.
