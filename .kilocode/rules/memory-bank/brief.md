Sailarr Installer is a fully automated script for deploying a comprehensive media server stack. It leverages Docker to set up and configure a suite of services that stream media from Real-Debrid through Plex. The core of the stack includes the *Arr applications (Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr) for library management, Zurg and Rclone for mounting Real-Debrid as a local filesystem, and Decypharr as a lightweight download client. The installer is interactive, allowing for customization of features like Traefik reverse proxy for HTTPS access and user authentication. It also includes health monitoring and automatic updates via Watchtower.
