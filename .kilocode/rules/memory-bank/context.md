The current focus of the project was to initialize the Memory Bank. All core files (`brief.md`, `product.md`, `tech.md`, `architecture.md`, and `context.md`) have been created based on a comprehensive analysis of the project's source code, documentation, and configuration files.

The next step is to await further instructions from the user. The Memory Bank is now active and will be used to inform all future tasks.
